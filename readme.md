# Introduction

These notes are based on my learnings  from Google's course: [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) 

> Android Basics with Compose is a self-paced, online course on how to build Android apps using the latest best practices. It covers the basics of building apps with Jetpack Compose, the recommended toolkit for building user interfaces on Android. - **Google Developers**

**IMPORTANT**: 

The table of contents and the descriptions or goals of units and pathways are copied from Google's official course.

This is not intended for any copyrights enfingements, this is designed to explain "how did learn I to code in Kotlin and JetPack compose", in addition to promoting the content of the course.

## How do I learn?
Personally I prefer practicle courses when it comes to learning a new language, library, or framework. I take notes as comments in my code sessions which will help me reduce the documentation fraction and remember things easily when I want to revise something.

> This documentation is open for contributions. 
Possible ways to help: 
- Improve to the quality of comments;
- Add references and possible learning roadmaps;
- Add written lectures to support the content of codes;
- Etc.
